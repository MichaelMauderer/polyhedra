Polyhedra
==========


This package contains some basic 3D geometry functionality (points, vectors, etc) but mostly serves as a
utility library to create and modify polyhedra.

At this point the functionality is limited to geodesic polyhedra based on icosahedra as well as their
corresponding goldberg polyedra.
